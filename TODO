This is a TODO list.

1. Add support for overlayfs
2. Create specific $TYPE settings as external sh script
3. Add feature to build ISO based on currently used OMV system -> omdv-iso.build.sh myiso name.iso ?
4. What else ?
5. Add the ability to retain downloaded rpms so that mods and rebuilds can be done quickly when 
   bandwidth is limited or debugging is required.
