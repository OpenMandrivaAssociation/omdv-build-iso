This is a TODO list.

1. Add support for overlayfs
2. Create specific $TYPE settings as external sh script
3. Add feature to build ISO based on currently used OMV system -> omdv-iso.build.sh myiso name.iso ? Done 
   but the name can't be chosen yet.
4. What else ?
5. Add the ability to retain downloaded rpms so that mods and rebuilds can be done quickly when 
   bandwidth is limited or debugging is required. Done
6. Allow users to create a remove list. The point? Create a KDE spin and remove the packages you dont want. Done
7. Allow users to create a local add list. The point? Same as above. Also keeps the package lists clean. Done
8: Method of reverting to minimal if you have built a larger package. Done 
9: Separate utility that enables simple mount operations on the existing chroot. Simple utility called ./mntem has been produced.
   Perhaps combined with apper and packagit
